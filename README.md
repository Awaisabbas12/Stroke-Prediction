# Stroke-Prediction
Strokes are a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide, often striking without warning and leaving devastating impacts on patients' lives. Timely and accurate prediction of stroke risks is a crucial step in mitigating these outcomes and providing life-saving interventions.

In this project, we harness the power of machine learning to develop robust classification models capable of predicting the risk of stroke. By analyzing patient data such as demographic profiles, medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements, our goal is to uncover critical patterns and enhance decision-making for healthcare professionals.
# Objective
Analyze and preprocess diverse patient data to identify key predictors of stroke.\
Engineer features and optimize datasets for improved model performance.\
Develop and evaluate multiple classification models, focusing on metrics like recall, precision, and AUC-ROC to ensure reliable predictions.\
Bridge the gap between predictive analytics and real-world healthcare applications.
